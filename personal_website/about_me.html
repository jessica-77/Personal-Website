                        I have grown up in Diamond Bar, California, for most of my life. Its a very quiet, suburban area,
                        with not a lot to do. As boring as it was growing up here, I'm also very grateful for all of 
                        the people, experiences, and opportunities I have had. 
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I have met many amazing people from all different backgrounds, and I have learned so much from them.
                        With that, it has allowed me to grow up as an open-minded person, who loves to try lots of different foods 
                        from many different cultures. My current favorite food is Japaense food. I love onigiri, sushi, 
                        and Japanese curry. 
                    </p>

                        Being in the area that I grew up in, I was also able to witness lifestyles that were completely new to me. 
                        Many of my classmates, aqquaintances, and close friends have come from a very different economic background than I have. 
                        It was very weird, confusing, and eye-opening experience for me, becasue of how unfamilar I was with it. 
                        Most, if not all, had very wealthy, educated parents, who were able to provide them with the best education. My parents 
                        were as supportive as they could be, but it was hard for them to provide me with the same opportunities.

                        I had never known exactly what I wanted to do with my life. My mother, being a teacher, would contanstly ask me that question, 
                        "so, what do you want to be when you grow up?". I think because I had constantly been asked that question, I never took it seriously. 
                        Even when I thought about it, long and hard, I was blank. I enjoyed math, but didn't know if I enjoyed it enough to make it my 
                        entire career. I enjoyed science, but I wasn't very good at it. I didn't enjoy history or writing, so what was left?

                        Fast forward to my senior year of high school. Its college application season, and I still have no idea what I want to do.
                        I had taken a computer science class my first semester as an elective, and I enjoyed it but it wasn't really for me. I had to do make 
                        a decision soon, and I was running out of time. My dad was with a tech company, so he suggested I try it out. I thought, "why not?", I have no other ideas.
                         I trust my ability to learn, and I like a challenge. For most of college applications, I put computer science as my major, but for some 
                         I put psychology. I rolled the dice and let fate decide my path.

                        I finally decide to go San Francisco State University, and I was so excited to start my new life. I was finally going to be on my own, 
                        and I was ready to take on the world. Moving far away from home was scary, but I was also excited to start a new chapter of my life. 
                        Unfortunately, it turned out to be the worst experience of my life, but I also learned a lot. After a year, covid happened, so I was back home, which 
                        was, honestly, exactly what I needed. It was a long journey, but eventually I was able to transfer to California State University, Fullerton.

                        If I'm being honest, I still don't really know if computer science is what I want do, but here we are...4 years later. 
                        It's a very interesting field and it makes me feel like a capable person, but at the same time it doesn't feel authenticslly me. 
                        I have found ways to make it enjoyable, but I do have lots of days where I doubt my capabilities.

                        I've found that making websites is the most fun for me. I love the ability to be creative and make something that aligns with my own passions. 
                        For example, I love animals, so I made a website that allows people to adoption dogs and cats. There are so many website ideas that I have and would love to create over the next 
                        few years. Computer science is a very broad field, and I'm grateful that I've found my own niche.
