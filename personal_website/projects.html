                <h2>Pet Adoption Website</h2>
                <p>
                    This project helps users explore cats and dogs that are up for adoption, rehome their own pet if 
                    they are no longer able to take care of them due to personal reasons, and make donations to help support the 
                    pets in need. The website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

                <h2>Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe Game</h2>
                <p>
                    This project is a more complex version of the classic tic-tac-toe game. Each of the 9 cells on a 3x3 board 
                    contains a smaller 3x3 tic-tac-toe board. The next board is chosen based on the position of the last move.
                    You are able to play against a friend or an AI bot. I built this game using python, tkinter, and the minimax algorithm 
                    combined with alpha-beta pruning and heuristic evaluation to make the AI bot play optimally.
